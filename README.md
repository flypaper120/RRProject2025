## 📚 Overview

This repository provides **clean, reproducible implementations** of the hybrid `ARIMA-GARCH` model and its forecasting, focusing more on the abillity to replicate, rather than to disprove

---

## ✅ Objectives

- Reproduce the models provided in the paper
- Analyze the data used in the initial research
- Compare outcomes and discuss discrepancies
- Summarize a conclusion, compare the result with the initial paper
